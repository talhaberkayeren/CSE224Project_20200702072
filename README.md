## ðŸ“š Project Description
The goal of this project was to design a simple CPU architecture using **Verilog HDL**, simulating the basic functionalities of a processor by implementing and connecting the following components:

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs basic arithmetic and logical operations  
- **Register File**: Stores intermediate values and operands  
- **Instruction Memory**: Contains the instructions to be executed  
- **Control Unit**: Decodes the instruction and generates necessary control signals  
- **Data Path**: Connects all components and ensures correct signal flow  

## ðŸ§ª Test and Simulation
The design was tested using Verilog testbenches and simulated via **Vivado 2016.3**. The waveform outputs were analyzed to validate the correctness of the instruction execution and component interactions.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- **Verilog HDL**
- **Vivado 2016.3**
